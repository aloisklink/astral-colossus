# Gift

`contracts` contains the (soon to be) deployed `DfdaoGift` contract.

`lib` contains the methods for crafting Flashbots bundles and DarkForest transactions in ethers

`plugins` contains the `DfdaoGift` plugin that users will use to send signed tx to the dao's `server`

`server` will receive the signedTX, populate and submit the flashbots bundle.


*note: None of this works yet :)*
